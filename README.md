**Vac**cination Site Management **Sy**stem

Large-scale vaccination sites have been set up in various places as an effective countermeasure against COVID-19, which is widespread all over the world. This system is used to manage the progress in such a vaccination site. 
This system is recreated as open source by the creator of the system operated at Fujita Medical University. The original system is a very simple one made in only three days.
I would like to ask for your cooperation and hope that this system will be used in various parts of the world and that vaccination will proceed speedy so that this global disaster will disappear sooner.
